        <p>Hi.  I'm Justin, and I like solving problems using math and computers.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I have long been fascinated with the intersection of computers and mathematics.  I remember being 17 and reading Bruce Schneier's <em>Applied Cryptography</em> in between customers at the airbursh shop where I worked one summer.  I didn't realize at that time that I could combine both of these in a career.  From my limited exposure to programming (i.e., <em>QBasic for Dummies</em>) it seemed that computer scientists were mainly concerned with building employee databases, while mathematicians... well I wasn't really sure what mathematicians did.  So I went into engineering.</p>
<p>Even as an undergraduate in nuclear engineering at Georgia Tech, I almost switched majors into discrete mathematics to turn my hobby of cryptography into a career.  But then I stumbled into an undergrad research position where I learned about the important role of computation in engineering.  That research project, which turned into a master's thesis and then a PhD, showed me that I could combine applied mathematics, programming and physics to solve important problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="recent-history">
<h2>Recent History</h2>
<p>After completing my PhD I moved to Pittsburgh, where I developed computational methods used to analyze the Navy's nuclear propulsion cores.  I developed and maintained software that generated data for reactor simulators, worked in a multidisciplinary team developing advanced simulation capability, and even developed some software for visualizing large-scale space and time-dependent datasets.</p>
<p>After a few years I wanted to broaden the scope of my work.  Working in the defense space felt a little isolated (machine guns at the gate, no cell phones, limited internet, etc.).  I was fortunately able to land a tenure-track faculty position at the University of Massachusetts Lowell where I have continued developing computational methods for radiation transport and reactor analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="present">
<h2>Present</h2>
<p>Life in academia is much different that it was at the lab, or even in graduate school, but fortunately I have had the freedom to start exploring other applications of computation.  The area most on my mind right now is machine learning.</p>
<p>Machine learning takes a different approach than most physics-based computational methods.  In most of the problems I have worked on there are prescribed input models, and the hard part is developing efficient algorithms to predict the outcome of those models in a way that is consistent with physics.  In machine learning the scales tip the other way.  Machine learning takes the &quot;physics&quot; constraint out of problems and replaces it with algorithms that can learn to build their own models based on data they see.</p>
<p>I see this as sort of an algorithmic abstraction: constraints are removed and replaced with parameters that adjust to match some context to which they are applied.  This means that machine learning algorithms can be applied in many different domains and problems because they are not <em>a pirori</em> contrained by prescriptive physics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="here-and-now">
<h2>Here and Now</h2>
<p>This blog is a collection of notes looking at machine learning, data science, computation, programming, applied mathematics and how all of these topics <em>intersect</em>.  Some posts will simply be about the go-to algorithms of machine learning.  Others will focus on examples and the practice of machine learning and data science.  Some may talk about some programming topic that's new to me.</p>
<p>The overarching theme (I think) will be looking at &quot;data science&quot; through the lens of &quot;computational science.&quot;  My version of computational science, includes progamming and a healthy does of mathematics at, say, the graduate engineering level.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by.  If you see anything that looks interesting I'd love to hear from you.</p>
