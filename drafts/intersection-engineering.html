        <p>Innovation is a word that gets thrown around a lot.  The Merriam-Webster definition is simply a &quot;new idea, device or method.&quot;  I think that sets the pretty low bar.  What if we define innovation as a <em>new way of thinking that radically changes the way we view and interact with the world</em>?</p>
<p>The focus of this definition is not the incremental, evolutionary progress that is made day-to-day and week-to-week.  It is the paradigm-shifting introduction of new ways of thinking.  The new ideas and technology that radically change our ways of thinking.  This in no way discounts the value of incremental improvement that drives human progress forward, but it establishes a higher tier of impact.  In fact, this high-level innovation often appears as a near step-change <em>because</em> it does not provide an improved solution to an existing problem but rather poses an entirely new question.</p>
<p>Can we identify a model for this type of innovation?  Catalysts?  Parameters?  I believe so.  In fact, this type of transformative innovation has historically led to intellectual revolutions.  Let's start with the revolution that brought us modern science.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-scientific-revolution">
<h2>The Scientific Revolution</h2>
<p>For most of human history we knew remarkably little about the universe in which we lived.  In the western world, the Greeks began changing this with rational explorations into the universe and human behavior.  For hundreds of years, however, what we would today call &quot;science&quot; was viewed as an extension of philosophy.  This philosophy of nature, or <em>natural philosophy</em>, was largely based on theoretical speculation of how and why the universe works the way it does.  In contrast to the modern study of science, natural philosphy was largely non-quantitative.</p>
<p>Mathematics has also existed since the time of the ancient Greeks.  Mathematics, however, was developed independently of natural philosophy.  The main developments of mathematics were in counting, geometry and basic algebra.  The applications of mathematics were in trade, finance, accounting, building, and art.</p>
<p>Then in 1687, Issac Newton produced a manuscript titled <em>Philsophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>: the mathematical principles of natural philosophy.  This work signaled a new epoch in humankind.  It transformed the way we think about the universe by uniting observation and quantitive reasoning in both a general and specific way.  He laid out the &quot;rules of reasoning in philosophy&quot; while also making concrete predictions regarding planetary sizes and motions.  This was the birth of modern science, the beginning of the scientific revoluion.</p>
<p>The scientific revolution caused an explosion of knowledge and progress.  This explosion of knowledge ultimately made it impossible for any one person to be well-versed in all corners of science.  Modern science, after all, is not <em>one</em> thing; it is a conglomeration of specialized fields.  We have physics, chemistry, geology, biology, and so on.  Today even these subfields are recursively subdivided and refined.  From physics we have theoretical, applied and experimental physics and sub-specialties such as quantum mechanics, nuclear structure, astrophysics, particle physics, etc.  At the deepest level of these recursions you may only find a few dozen people in the world who qualify as true experts (typically professional academics) who have obtained the &quot;expert&quot; status by going <em>deeper</em> than anyone before.</p>
<p>This structure indicates the first taste of the dichotomy of true innovation.  Newton upended natural reasoning by intersecting mathematics and natural philosophy, not by going deeper in either direction.  Yet the resulting explosion of knowledge forced specialization on those who followed.  In fact, the advanced development of any field of science <em>requires</em> specialization.  Specialization, however, inhibits the type of general, wholistic thinking that is the catalyst for innovation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-industrial-revolution">
<h2>The Industrial Revolution</h2>
<p>The creation of modern science led to deep understandings of the way the universe works, especially at a mechanical and thermodynamic level.  Roughly XXX years after Newton published his seminal work, a new revolution began: the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution was cataylzed by another big intersection between two areas of knowledge.  This time the merger was between the academic pursuit of science and the pragmatic execution of crafts and trades.  The result was scalable, efficient and productive industry.  Today we call this technology, literally, the science of craft.</p>
<p>As in the scientific revolution ushered in by Newton, the industrial revolution was ignited by looking broadly, across domains, rather than deeply within any single domain.  This new way of thinking, ironically, spurred further and deeper specialization. The poster child of modern specialization is perhaps Henry Ford.  He exploited specialization in the mass production of cars.  Rather than teach five people how build a car, you can teach each one how to build <em>part</em> of a car.  This is certainly a more efficient approach, but the result is that fewer people know how to build an entire car.  This metaphor extends generally to the role of specialization in complex world of modern knowledge: broad knowledge is sacrificed at the altar of deep knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-section">
<h2>Next Section</h2>
<p>This pattern of domain intersections leading to rapid growth has also happened in the twentieth century at various scales.  Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>In late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries physicst discovered radiation and nuclear fission.  The latter, in particular, was quickly recognized as a potential technological game-changer.  As is often the case, the military realized this potential for this new discovery to be weaponized.  The world was also at war, so the government was willing to pump funding into accelearting the weaponization of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>The task of developing a nuclear weapon was conceptually simple but technologically formidable.  In part the difficuly was that there were no specialists who could be called upon to direct the project.  The required knowledge was fragmented across physics, mathematics, chemistry and metallurgy, and none of those domains contained enough depth to pull off the project in isolation.</p>
<p>As a result, the Manhattan Project assembled top minds from across disciplines and isolated them on top of a New Mexico mesa.  This was a staged collaboration of immense and intense proportions.  It was a staged intersection of traditional domains.  The result, yes, was the successful development of a weapon of mass desctrution, the ethics of which were questioned by its very creators.  On the other hand, the field of nuclear engineering was born.  This field has brought the world nuclear medicine, advanced imaging, and a carbon-free power production industry.  As with most technology, there are good and bad elements of this area of technology, but it also exemplifies what can happen you bring together diverse backgrounds and expertise around a central goal.  This is what can happen when you pull specialists up from their holes of specialization (or down from their ivory towers) and force them to work collaboratively and broadly, out of their comfort zones.</p>
<p>A more recent example of innovating broadly is data science: the queen of intersections.  You don't have to look far in data science to see a picture of a Venn diagram, showing how data scientists live at the intersection of software, mathematics and some particular domain of knowledge (business, for example.)  The case of data science is an interesting example of intersection innovation.  All of the components of data science, from computing to machine learning to business analytics, have existed for decades.  The potential of data science, in various domains, has also been known for some time, perhaps under the name of intelligence or analytics.  The intersection has only recent caused the explosion of the data industry, however, because of the emergence of two important catalytsts: large amounts of detailed data (big data) and the computational horsepower to do something with it.</p>
<p>Neural networks, for example, were introducted in the 19kk's.  There was really not enough data widely available to make training neural networks widely applicable, however.  Furthermore, computers were not fast enough to make the process of training neural networks efficient enough to be widely deployed in business and industrly.  Those two obstacles have largely been eradicated at this point, and various manifestations of neural networks, and machine learning in general, are appearing everywhere from speach recognition to computer vision to robotics to credit card fraud detection.  It will soon be driving our cars.  This explosion was caused by an intersection of traditional domains, to be sure, but the catalyst of computation was a necessary ingredient.  Computation was the flame to the fuel that sparked wide-spread innovation.</p>
<p>The catalyst of compuation is sparking innovation in multiple more niche fields as well.  In engineering simulation, for example, it is often required to solve multiple &quot;types of physics&quot; at the same time.  Micro-electronics may require solving electronic, magnetic, heat and fluid equations all at the same time.  Nuclear reactor simulations ideally solve radiation, heat, fluid and mechanical equations all at the same time.  Coupling, combining or intersecting, these physics within one &quot;master&quot; simulation has been coined multiphysics.  I believe multiphysics is largely still in its infancy.  It's slow growth may, in part, be atributed to the niche fields where it is applied.  Fields where specialization still reigns and there has not been a concerted effort to force multi-disciplenar, cross-functional engineering design.  The reason why this technology has not already been adopted in newer fields, such as nuclear engineering, is that coupling physics in this manner produces a much harder problem than de-coupled simulations.  Computation is the catalyst that makes is only recent making it <em>possible</em> to do multiphysics.  Now we need the driver to make multiphysics a new way of thinking.</p>
<p>Mental models create blindness.  The more mental models you have, the more you start to connect and blind yourself, UNLESS you have built in reality checks or opportunities for reality to leak in. (Venkatesh Rao, Knowledge Project)</p>
